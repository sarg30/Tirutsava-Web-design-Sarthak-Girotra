    <p>
    Alan Walker is the son of Hilde Omdal Walker, a Norwegian, and Philip Alan Walker, an Englishman. By birth, he was
    granted dual citizenship, both in Norway and the United Kingdom on the basis of his parental origin. At the age of two,
    he moved to Bergen, Norway, with his parents and siblings. Walker grew up with two siblings, an older sister,
    Camilla, born in England, and a younger brother, Andreas, born in Norway.
    
    Growing up in the digital era, Walker found an early interest in computers, which later turned into a fascination for
    programming and graphic design. He initially had no musical background; however, he later taught himself by watching
    tutorials on YouTube based on music production.

    In 2012, Walker was listening to a song by Italian DJ David Whistle (also known as DJ Ness) and reached out to him to
    find out how he produced his music. He was inspired by EDM producers K-391 and Ahrix, and by film composers like Hans
    Zimmer and Steve Jablonsky. He started producing his music on his laptop using FL Studio. In July 2012, with the help
    and feedback from his fans online, he began pursuing his music production career and slowly began posting his music to
    YouTube and SoundCloud. Starting as a bedroom producer, he was better known as DJ Walkzz before signing a record deal
    and releasing his debut single in 2014.
    
    Walker released the track "Fade" on 17 August 2014. The track gained attention after its re-release via the record
    label NoCopyrightSounds on 19 November 2014. Walker stated that the creation of the track was inspired by K-391 and
    Ahrix, whose tracks were also picked up by the record label. The track has over 400 million views on YouTube, 115
    million plays on Spotify, and 41 million streams on SoundCloud. The tracks "Spectre" and "Force" followed in
    2015.
    
    Walker signed with MER Musikk under Sony Music Sweden and released his next single, "Faded", a remastered vocal version
    of "Fade". It was released on 8 December 2015 and featured uncredited Naustdal pop singer Iselin Solheim. The single
    topped the year-end charts in Austria, Germany, Switzerland and Sweden, iTunes charts in 33 countries, as well as
    entering top 10 in Spotify Global Chart. The music video on YouTube has over 2.6 billion views and 18 million likes,
    placing it among the top 10 most liked YouTube videos. It has over 1.1 billion plays on Spotify, and is also one of
    the Top 10 Most Shazamed tracks of 2016. The single also received official remixes from Tiësto,Dash Berlin, and
